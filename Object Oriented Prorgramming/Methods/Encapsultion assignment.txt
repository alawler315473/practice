Fix the access modifiers so that they are as  restrictive as possible and satisfy the requirements below.
For each change that you make you will need to list it here and explain why you made the change.

You should be able to create an object of each of the classes.
1)Changed all constructors to public, so all classes can create a class object

The MakeSound method should not be able to be called besides by other methods in one of the derived classes.
2)changed makeSOund in Animal class to protected, now only acessed by derived classes. 

The DunkFaceInMilk method should only be available to the himalayan class.
3) changed DunkDaceInMilk to private, only can be acessed by its own class.

all other methods should be accessible everywhere
4)changed all other methods to public, accessible everywhere

the hasDrugs property of the GermanShepard class should be accesible in its class and its derived classes.
5)changed hasDrugs to protected bool, making it only accessible to its class or derived class.

all other properties should only be accesible in their class and not their derived classes
6)xhanged all properties to private, making all class properties less unacessible.

Example:
	1.Switched BostonTerrier Constructor to public because it needs to be able to be called from another file to create an obect of the BostonTerrier Class
